// Coding Challenge #1

/* 
Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.
Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:

1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and the LAST TWO dogs actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters)
2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy üê∂")
4. Run the function for both test datasets

HINT: Use tools from all lectures in this section so far üòâ

TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data[4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data[10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

GOOD LUCK üòÄ

const checkDogs = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
    // 1. Make a shallow copy of dogsJulia
    const juliaCopy = [...dogsJulia];

    // 2. Remove the first and last two elements from the copy
    const juliaCorrected = juliaCopy.slice(1, -2);
    // 3. Merge the corrected Julia data with dogsKate

    const merged = juliaCorrected.concat(dogsKate);
    // 4. Loop over the merged array

    merged.forEach(function (dog, i) {
        // 5. Inside the loop, check if age >= 3
        if (dog >= 3) {
            console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is an adult, and is ${dog} years old`);

        } else {
            console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is still a puppy üê∂`);

        }
    })
};

// Run the function with test data
checkDogs([3, 5, 2, 12, 7], [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]);
checkDogs([9, 16, 6, 8, 3], [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]);


// Coding Challenge #2
// Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.

// Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:

// 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4.
// 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
// 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know from other challenges how we calculate averages üòâ)
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets

// TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

// GOOD LUCK üòÄ

const calcAverageHumanAge = function (ages) {
    // 1. Map dog ages to human ages
    
    //    rule: if age <= 2 ‚Üí 2 * age, else ‚Üí 16 + age * 4
    const dogAges = ages.map(function(age){
        if(age <= 2 ){
            return 2 * age;
            
        }else
            return 16 + age * 4
        })
    
    // 2. Filter out dogs with human age < 18
    
       const dogsHumanAge = dogAges.filter(function(age){
        return age >= 18
        }) 
    // 3. Calculate the average of remaining human ages
    //    
        const sum = dogsHumanAge.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0)
        const average = sum / dogsHumanAge.length
    // 4. Return or log the average
        return average
};

// Run the function with test data
console.log(calcAverageHumanAge([5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]));
console.log(calcAverageHumanAge([16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]));


///////////////////////////////////////
// Coding Challenge #3


Rewrite the 'calcAverageHumanAge' function from the previous challenge, but this time as an arrow function, and using chaining!
TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

GOOD LUCK üòÄ!

const calcAverageHumanAge = (ages) => ages
    .map(age => age <= 2 ? 2 * age : 16 + age * 4)
    .filter(age => age > 18)
    .reduce((acc, curr, _, arr) => acc + curr / arr.length, 0);

console.log(calcAverageHumanAge([5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]));
console.log(calcAverageHumanAge([16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]));

// Coding Challenge #4


This time, Julia and Kate are studying the activity levels of different dog breeds.

YOUR TASKS:
1. Store the the average weight of a "Husky" in a variable "huskyWeight"
2. Find the name of the only breed that likes both "running" and "fetch" ("dogBothActivities" variable)
3. Create an array "allActivities" of all the activities of all the dog breeds
4. Create an array "uniqueActivities" that contains only the unique activities (no activity repetitions). HINT: Use a technique with a special data structure that we studied a few sections ago.
5. Many dog breeds like to swim. What other activities do these dogs like? Store all the OTHER activities these breeds like to do, in a unique array called "swimmingAdjacent".
6. Do all the breeds have an average weight of 10kg or more? Log to the console whether "true" or "false".
7. Are there any breeds that are "active"? "Active" means that the dog has 3 or more activities. Log to the console whether "true" or "false".

BONUS: What's the average weight of the heaviest breed that likes to fetch? HINT: Use the "Math.max" method along with the ... operator.
