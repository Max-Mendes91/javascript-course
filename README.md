  - Two-player dice game with full UI
  - Complex state handling (`scores`, `currentScore`, `activePlayer`, `playing`)
  - Event handling, UI state transitions
  - Game rules implementation

### **Advanced Topics**
- **`Assignments lecture 9/`** - Modern JavaScript mastery
  - **1,049 lines** of comprehensive exercises
  - **20+ exercise categories** covering modern JavaScript features
  - **4 major coding challenges** including interactive web applications
  - **Key Topics Covered:**
    - Array & Object Destructuring (nested, default values)
    - Spread/Rest operators and parameters
    - Logical operators (short-circuiting, nullish coalescing)
    - Sets and Maps data structures
    - String manipulation and processing
    - Optional chaining and computed properties
    - For-of loops and object methods
    - Dynamic DOM creation and event handling
  - **Real-world Applications:**
    - Football betting app with data manipulation
    - Book management system with complex datasets
    - Variable name converter (interactive web app)
    - Game event tracking and analysis

## Prerequisites
- **Basic HTML/CSS knowledge** (for DOM projects)
- **Modern web browser** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
- **Optional**: Local server (VS Code Live Server) for convenience
- **Text editor** with JavaScript syntax highlighting

## How to Run

### **Basic Exercises**
1. Navigate to any folder (e.g., `fundamentals-1/`, `fundamentals-2/`)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Open DevTools Console (F12) to view output
4. Uncomment specific sections in `script.js` to run them
5. **Tip**: Run one block at a time to avoid variable re-declaration errors

### **Interactive Projects**
1. Open `GuessMyNumber/` or `PigGame/` folder
2. Open `index.html` in browser
3. Interact directly with the web interface
4. No console needed - full UI experience

### **Advanced Assignments**
1. Open `Assignments lecture 9/` folder
2. Open `index.html` in browser
3. Most exercises require console interaction
4. **Coding Challenge #4** has active web interface
5. Uncomment exercise blocks as needed

- **1,000+ lines** of JavaScript code across all modules
- **Progressive difficulty** from basics to advanced concepts
- **Real-world datasets** (books, sports, games)
- **Multiple solution approaches** (student + instructor examples)

### **Modern JavaScript**
- **ES6+ features**: destructuring, spread/rest, arrow functions
- **Advanced data structures**: Sets, Maps, complex objects
- **Modern operators**: nullish coalescing, optional chaining
- **String processing**: pattern matching, formatting, manipulation

### **Interactive Learning**

## Notes & Tips

### **Execution Guidelines**
- Some examples use `prompt()` and will pause for input (browser only)
- Commented snippets may include intentional mistakes for learning
- Wrap sections in `{ ... }` or functions to avoid scope conflicts
- Use browser DevTools for debugging and exploration

### **Learning Strategy**
- **Start with fundamentals** - build strong foundation
- **Practice regularly** - uncomment and run exercises
- **Experiment freely** - modify code and see results
- **Read the comments** - they contain valuable explanations
- **Check each folder's README** for specific details

### **Advanced Features**
- **Real datasets**: 8 programming books with comprehensive metadata
- **Complex algorithms**: string processing, data transformation
- **Interactive web apps**: dynamic DOM creation, event handling
- **Modern syntax**: ES6+ features throughout advanced sections
