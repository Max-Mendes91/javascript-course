# JavaScript Course

A hands-on repository for learning core JavaScript concepts with small, focused exercises. Each folder contains an HTML file that loads a corresponding script with self-contained examples and challenges.

## Structure
- `fundamentals-1/`
  - Intro topics: values/variables, data types, let/const, strings, if/else, logical operators, type conversion/coercion, equality operators, switch, ternary, and small challenges (BMI, team averages, tip calculator).
- `fundamentals-2/`
  - Next topics: strict mode, functions (declaration/expression/arrow), functions calling functions, arrays and common methods, objects (dot vs bracket, methods, this), and loops (for, backwards, nested). Includes comprehensive exercises: team score comparisons, tip calculator with arrays, BMI object methods, voting simulation, and population calculations.

See each folder's `README.md` for details specific to that part.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
- Optional: a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) for convenience

## How to run
1. Open a folder (e.g., `fundamentals-1/` or `fundamentals-2/`).
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Open DevTools Console to view output.
4. Uncomment specific sections in the corresponding `script.js` to run them (most files group topics in blocks). To avoid variable re-declaration errors, run one block at a time or wrap sections in their own scope `{ ... }`/function.

## Notes
- Some examples use `prompt(...)` and will pause execution until input is provided (browser only).
- A few commented snippets intentionally include minor mistakes for learning—fix them when you want to execute those parts.

## Contributing / Personal Notes
This repo is for personal learning. Feel free to add notes per section, refactor repeated code, and create additional challenges to reinforce concepts.
